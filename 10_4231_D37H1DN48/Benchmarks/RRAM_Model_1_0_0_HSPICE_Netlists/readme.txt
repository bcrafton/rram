Readme for Sample Spice Files   1. DCSweep.sp is a template spice file to execute DC testing on a RRAM cell. 2. pulseSweep.sp is a template spice file to execute pulse testing on a RRAM cell.  In both files, X1 defines a RRAM device. (Please refer to the manual for model 'rram_v_1_0_0' detailed parameters definition.)  a. Device initial mode defination. Two X1 definations in each file. "* HRS/LRS initial" indicates the device is initially in HRS/LRS mode. TAKE CARE! There are two X1 definations written in the codes for your convenience, one under "* HRS initial" and the other under "* LRS initial". Please only use(uncomment) one X1 definination to avoid X1 defination conflicts and to properly call the program.  b.  Input defination. Two Vin definations in each file. "DC(Pulse) SET/RESET" indicates the programming process to SET/RESET RRAM devices. When RRAM is in HRS mode, it requires "Vin" to SET the device correspondingly; also when RRAM is in LRS mode, it requires the input to RESET the device. PLEASE CHOOSE the input voltage defination according to device initial mode defination.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
plot instruction for DCSweep:
1. Please use Voltage as X-axis and Current as Y-axis. 
2. Please use log-scale for Y-axis.
3. For one transient simulation(SET or RESET sweep), you’ll only get one half (SET or RESET correspondingly) of the DC switching curve.
